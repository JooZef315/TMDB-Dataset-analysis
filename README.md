# TMDB Dataset analysis


udacity data analyst nanodegree project

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database TMDb (https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)
This is a great place to start digging in to those questions, with data on the crew, budget, and revenues of several thousand films.

I used pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
